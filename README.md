### What Do You Want?
  - Understand what MPS is
    - [What is MPS and why to build your own language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BvpBLzzprA)
  - See what others have been building with MPS
    - [Build with MPS](#build-with-mps) are open source projects that all build on MPS
    - [Research](#research) contains a list academic papers that make heavy use of MPS
  - Get started with building stuff on top of MPS
    - To get stated we suggest to look at the tutorials in the following order
      - [MPS for the Impatient](https://stepik.org/course/71593/) is a free hands-on course that covers the basics of JetBrains MPS from the language designer's perspective, skipping the theoretical topics as well as the practical productivity how-tos.

      - [MPS Intro Course by @markusvoelter](https://github.com/markusvoelter/mpsintrocourse) is an advanced introduction to MPS in the form of multiple videos as well as a github repository to play around with. It also covers extensions to MPS such as additional notations or the interpreter framework.
      - [Grammar Cells](http://mbeddr.com/files/gc-sle.pdf) An extension to the editor language of MPS. It will help you to create consistent and well-behaving textual notations in MPS with no effort.
      - If you are specificly looking for input on how to build generators [this guide](https://coolya.github.io/maintainable-generators/) contains a set of best practices.
      - The [DSL Engineering Book](http://dslbook.org/) contains detailed discussions of the concepts behind MPS in its Part III on language implementation.
      - For more details on specific MPS topics we refer to [2 books on MPS](http://campagnelab.org/publications/our-books/) as well as the official [MPS User Guide](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/MPSD20173/MPS+User%27s+Guide)
